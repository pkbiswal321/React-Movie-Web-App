          '<p><b>The Price is Right</b>, originally hosted by Bob Barker until 2007 and Drew Carey thereafter -- features a wide variety of games and contests with the same basic challenge: Guess the prices of everyday (or not-quite-everyday) retail items. Four contestants, all of whom are seated in one of the wildest audiences in daytime game-show history, are called to the stage to play a preliminary pricing round. That winner joins the host on stage for one of more than 70 different pricing games. After three such games, the contestants spin a big wheel -- hoping to get as close to $1 as possible -- in the "Showcase Showdown". The two highest winners of that round advance to the final, where prizes could be cars or roomsful of furniture. A trio of models presents the prizes.</p>',

          '<p><b>Rachael Ray</b>, also known as <i>Rachael</i> and <i>The Rachael Ray Show</i>, is an American talk show starring Rachael Ray that debuted in syndication in the United States and Canada on September 18, 2006 and also airs in other countries. It is taped at Chelsea Television Studios in New York City. The show\'s 8th season premiered on September 9, 2013, and became the last Harpo show in syndication to switch to HD with a revamped studio. The concept behind this program showcases Ray\'s culinary skills. She brings various celebrities on screen to discuss their accomplishments in the entertainment, sports, and media industries. Ray asks for tips and strategies for staying healthy and safe from various health and lifestyle experts, she includes make-over segments, and features musical performances, all of which are features along the same lines of <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>. She does, however, keep cooking in the forefront by including at least one cooking segment at the end of each episode, and sometimes inviting her celebrity guests to join her in the kitchen. According to Ray, "People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share". The set has the audience seated on a large turntable that rotates so that the audience can always see the "action" on the circular stage that surrounds them. At the end of each show, with the exception of a few more guests after Ray\'s cooking segments, Ray\'s tagline is, "We\'ll see you when we see you".</p>',

          "<p><b>Tyler Perry's The Haves and the Have Nots</b> is a television drama from the prolific writer, director and producer Tyler Perry. The show follows the complicated dynamic between the rich and powerful Cryer family and the hired help who work in their opulent Savannah, Georgia, mansion.<br><br> From the outside, the Cryers are the enviable face of success and wealth, but behind the veil, the family's dysfunction threatens to destroy their world of privilege. Cryer family patriarch Jim Cryer (John Schneider) is a powerful judge whose double life, including tawdry affairs with high-priced escorts, puts his family and political ambitions at risk. His wife, Katheryn Cryer (Renée Lawless), is the ultimate matriarch, portraying a loving and dutiful wife, but she is willing to do anything to protect her family's status. Their son, Wyatt (Aaron O'Connell), is a troubled, angry jock who cares little for his own image and finds himself in and out of rehab. His sister, Amanda (Jacyln Betham), a struggling law student, tries harder to live up to her parents' expectations but unknowingly has befriended a scurrilous young woman, Candace Young, with the power to ruin the entire family.</p>",

From the tallest pyramids to an underwater city, experts take viewers on an unforgettable journey.</p><p>Unearthed fuses elements of engineering, history, geology, and archaeology, revealing the deepest secrets of each structure. We'll see the latest technology used to solve mysteries such as how the Parthenon still stands against earthquakes; how sticky rice was used to build the Great Wall of China; and what sacred secret lies beneath the Mayan temples of Chichen Itza.</p><p>They may be older structures, but scientists and archaeologists use the latest technology including LiDAR scanning, X-ray imaging, carbon dating, and 3D printing techniques to reveal secrets of the past in ways that weren't possible before. Unearthed shows the future of science and technology are key to understanding our past, and without these developments, we wouldn't be able to unravel some of the world's greatest mysteries.</p>",

          "<p><b>Chopped </b>is a cooking competition show that is all about skill, speed and ingenuity. Each week, four chefs compete before a panel of expert judges and turn baskets of mystery ingredients into an extraordinary three-course meal. Course by course, the chefs will be \"chopped\" from the competition until only one winner remains. The challenge? They have seconds to plan and 30 minutes to cook an amazing course with the basket of mystery ingredients given to them moments before the clock starts ticking! And the pressure doesn't stop there. Once they've completed their dish, they've got to survive the Chopping Block where our three judges are waiting to be wowed and not shy about voicing their culinary criticisms! Our host, Ted Allen, leads this high-energy, high-pressure show that will have viewers rooting for a winner and cheering for the losers. <i>Chopped</i> is a game of passion, expertise and skill — and in the end, only one chef will survive the Chopping Block. Who will make the cut? The answer is on <i>Chopped!</i></p>",

          "<p>Kelli Finglass, the DCC director, has a mandate to have a squad of 36, making this a super competitive year. New to the mix of judges this year are two celebrities -- former DCC and Dancing with the Stars winner Melissa Rycroft and platinum-selling country music recording artist Neil McCoy. With 55 high caliber new girls making it to finals, it's intimidating for the 30 veterans as they must fight to keep their place on the team. Unfortunately for a few vets, it's the end of the line. For the super talented 43 who make training camp, the exhilaration is short lived as the reality of the most demanding dance audition in professional sports becomes real. Season nine brings everything you love -- girls reaching for their dreams and the emotional, drama-ridden journey to make them come true. The payoff is becoming part of the best team in the business -- the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.</p>",

          '<p>Stephen Colbert takes over as host of The Late Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and lest known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!</p>',
